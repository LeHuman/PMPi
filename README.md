# PMPi

Wireless PM2813 GPIB Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

This project hardware should be adaptable to other GPIB interfaces in a one to one configuration,
as communication still occurs through the same hardware. However, larger networks with more than two nodes are untested and might run into current capacity issues,
where this device cannot output much current compared to what standard IEEE-488 transceivers can, such as with the SN7516x chips. This, again, is untested.
